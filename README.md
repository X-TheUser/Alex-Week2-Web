This is my second web development assignment under the Power Learning Project scholarship.
Within this web page I have included:
An ordered list with roman numerals.
5 external images from pexels.
A table with 5 contacts.
A registration form.
And lastly i decided to include nav links to separate the contact page, registration page and the index page.
